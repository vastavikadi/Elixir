If you want to get Elixir for your windows machine, simply use Chocolatey. Open your command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
choco install elixir
```

This will install Elixir along with all its dependencies. Make sure you have Chocolatey installed on your system before running this command.

You gotta add the path to your Elixir installation to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to run Elixir commands from any command prompt window.

Go to your System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables, and find the PATH variable in the System variables section. Click Edit and add the path to your Elixir installation (usually `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\elixir\tools\bin`) to the list of paths.
